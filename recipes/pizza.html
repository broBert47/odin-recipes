    <p><h3><strong>Description</strong></h3></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>
    <p><h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3></p>

    <p><h3><strong>Steps to make</strong></h3></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer. Do this in steps as described in the written recipe below.</li>
        <li>Knead by hand or beat the dough with your mixer. I like doing this by hand and you can watch me in the video.</li>
        <li>Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2.</li>
        <li>Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and rest as you prep the pizza toppings.</li>
        <li>Top with favorite pizza toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake pizza at a very high temperature for only about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
